The AI engineer's work transitioned from an MVP to a full-stack, chat-driven code generation tool. The trajectory details a challenging development process marked by persistent LLM integration, UI rendering, and state management issues. Initial efforts focused on fixing ESLint, implementing a multi-tenant UI, and basic chat/project features. A major pivot occurred when real code generation was required, leading to extensive backend ( endpoint, chat persistence, artifact storage) and frontend (iframe preview, code viewer, auth) updates.

Continuous problems included LLM fallback to stub, UI unresponsiveness, and preview display failures, which often led to user frustration. A significant architectural redesign was undertaken to resolve fundamental issues like race conditions, data model mismatches, and inconsistent data flow. Post-redesign, specific bugs like non-functional delete, incorrect preview height, and iframe security restrictions (blob vs. srcDoc) were tackled. The current state is debugging the iframe  attribute for the preview, which is still blank despite containing valid HTML.

<product_requirements>
The application, branded WΞBMΛTIC.dev, aims to be a full-stack, chat-driven design and development tool using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Key features include:

1.  **Core Project Management**: Users can create, name, and describe projects.
2.  **AI Code Generation**: Utilizes LLMs (e.g., , ) to generate structured code (frontend, backend, database files) and a full  based on chat prompts. A stub fallback is required for LLM failures.
3.  **Chat-driven UI**:
    *   **Home Page**: A central chat for new projects and a grid of existing project cards.
    *   **Project Page ()**: A two-pane layout (25% left for chat/tabs: Home, Agent, Files; 75% right for output/tabs: Preview, Code). Resizable columns and styled tabs are required.
4.  **Output Display**: Preview tab renders  in an iframe; Code tab shows a clickable file list and selected file content. Generating... progress, AI/STUB badge, and explicit error messages are essential.
5.  **Persistence**: Chat history and generated artifacts (, ) are stored per project.
6.  **Authentication**: Basic email/password JWT authentication; code generation requires login, with an inline banner for unauthenticated users.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **LLM Integration**:  library,  for unified LLM access (Claude, GPT).
-   **UI/UX**: shadcn/ui components (DropdownMenu, AlertDialog, ResizablePanel, Tabs), Tailwind CSS.
-   **Authentication**: JWT for secure API access.
-   **Iframe Rendering**:  and  URLs for embedding HTML content, with  attributes.
-   **State Management**: React , ,  for managing component state and data flow.

**Key Files and Changes**:
-   : Central to code generation. Heavily modified to correctly use   and , improved regex for robust JSON extraction from LLM responses, adjusted  for better content, and added aggressive JSON repair.
-   :  model updated to consistently include  (with , ), ,  (AI/Stub), and . This ensures a unified data structure.
-   :  for rename and  for project deletion were added. The chat/generate logic was moved to new routers.
-    (NEW): Handles  for persisting chat messages.
-    (NEW): Handles  for initiating code/preview generation, containing the main LLM call logic and error handling.
-   : Entry point for . Refactored for full-width UI, integrated an  for project deletion (replacing ), and improved the initial project creation flow to ensure navigation and generation.
-   : Core component for . Underwent a major architectural redesign for clean state management, full-width UI, fixed preview iframe height, and robust content rendering. It now uses  with  attributes for iframe preview to address cross-origin issues. Contains  for delete confirmation. Fixes for infinite rendering loops were implemented by adjusting  dependencies.
-   : Updated to include the  method for project deletion.
-   : Modified to support optional authentication for certain endpoints, allowing read access without login.
-   : Main FastAPI app updated to integrate the new  and  modules.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Persist the left/right panel split size per project.
-   Show assistant messages in the chat when generation succeeds (e.g., “Generated 1 file(s) and preview”). (Partially addressed during refactor, but might still need explicit implementation for specific messages).
-   Add a loading state on the Preview tab iframe during generation.
-   Show a small “Generated at” timestamp from the last run.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was debugging a persistent blank preview issue in the  component, despite prior attempts to fix it. The user reported that their tests showed no preview, although the system claimed to have generated files and a preview.

The AI engineer found console errors related to cross-origin restrictions: Blocked a frame with origin https://app.emergent.sh from accessing a frame with origin null. Protocols, domains, and ports must match. This indicated that the previous  URL approach for the iframe  attribute was being blocked in the HTTPS production environment when accessed via .

After consulting the troubleshoot agent, the AI engineer switched the iframe rendering back from  URLs to  with specific  attributes. While backend tests indicated this  approach worked, the user's latest report still showed a blank preview.

The very last finding was a console warning: An iframe which has both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin for its sandbox attribute can escape its sandboxing. This suggests the current  configuration itself is causing the iframe not to render the content, despite the HTML being valid and present. The problem is a fundamental iframe security restriction.

<optional_next_step>
Fix the iframe  configuration in  to correctly render the HTML content without security warnings.

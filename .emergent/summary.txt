The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack application from scratch, iteratively implementing features based on user feedback and best practices. The development trajectory highlights an initial MVP focus shifting to robust architecture and comprehensive testing. Key challenges involved refactoring a monolithic backend into a modular, feature-based structure, integrating a third-party LLM API (), handling complex UI state for LLM provider and model selection, and resolving critical CORS/backend stability issues caused by incorrect imports and exception handling. The AI engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, particularly with frontend linting errors and backend import/CORS conflicts. Architectural decisions prioritized modularity, environment variable usage, and adherence to specific URL/port rules. The most recent work focused on implementing a minimal JWT authentication layer and a provider comparison tool.

The goal is to build a full-stack application using React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB (database). The initial focus was on delivering a rapid MVP to demonstrate core value, which later shifted to building a robust, well-organized, and testable system ready for real-world use.

Key features implemented and their requirements:
-   **Core Application:** A project management tool allowing users to create projects with a name and description.
-   **AI Planning Integration:** The application should leverage LLMs to generate structured development plans (frontend, backend, database steps) for a given project description. This evolved to include:
    -   Support for multiple LLM providers (Claude, GPT, Auto-select).
    -   Strict enforcement and hardcoding of specific, current LLM models (, ).
    -   A UI selector for choosing the provider and model.
    -   A robust fallback mechanism to a deterministic stub plan if the LLM call fails.
-   **Modular Architecture:** Avoid monolithic files, especially in the frontend, and adopt a feature-folder structure for better organization. Backend should also be modularized.
-   **Automated Testing:** Implement and run automated tests regularly for both backend and frontend functionality.
-   **Template Gallery:** Provide pre-defined templates (e.g., SaaS CRM, Billing SaaS, Analytics Dashboard) to accelerate project creation, serving as intent accelerators and guardrails for the AI planner.
    -   Templates can include parameters/overrides that merge into the planner's input.
-   **Run History:** Track and display a history of plan generation runs for each project, including the provider, model, mode (AI/stub), and timestamps.
-   **Provider Comparison:** A utility to compare plans generated by different LLM providers (Claude vs. GPT) for a given project, showing structured differences.
-   **Authentication:** Implement a basic email/password authentication system (register/login) to protect mutation routes.

-   **Containerization:** Application running in a Kubernetes container environment.
-   **Environment Variables:** Strict rules for , , , , .
-   **UI Framework:** shadcn/ui components for modern and stylish UI. Tailwind CSS for styling.

-   **LLM Integration:**  library for unified access to Claude/GPT models with a single .
-   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with HS256 for server-side authentication.
-   **CORS:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration and debugging.
-   **Build Tools:**  for React, backend                          RUNNING   pid 84, uptime 0:00:01

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the implementation of a minimal JWT authentication layer and a provider comparison utility.

**Backend:**
-   **Authentication:**
    -    (email, password) now returns an .
    -    (email, password) also returns an .
    -    with  returns user ID and email.
    -   The JWT secret is managed via  ().
    -   A  collection in MongoDB stores user details (UUID , email, password hash, created\_at).
-   **Provider Comparison:**
    -   A new backend endpoint  was added. This endpoint takes a project ID, generates two independent plans using  and  models, records these as runs, and returns a structured diff highlighting unique and overlapping plan items for frontend, backend, and database sections.
-   **Stability & Hardening:**
    -   Fixed persistent CORS/502 errors by correcting backend import paths to absolute style in  and other modules.
    -   Refined CORS handling: if  is ,  is set to  to adhere to browser security rules.
    -   De-coupled LLM error handling from specific  imports, preventing backend crashes if the library's exceptions were not available at runtime. Generic  catching with a stub plan fallback ensures stability.
-   **Model Enforcement:** Backend now strictly validates the provided LLM model against an allowlist (, ), returning a 400 error if an unsupported model is used.

**Frontend:**
-   **Authentication UI:**
    -   A new  component in the header provides Login and Register buttons.
    -   Clicking these opens  dialogs with email/password input fields.
    -   Upon successful login/registration, the received JWT  is stored in  as .
    -   An Axios interceptor () automatically attaches this token as an  header to all outgoing API requests.
    -   Crucially, key action buttons (Create Project, Generate Plan, Create from Template, Compare Providers) are now disabled if the user is not authenticated.
-   **Provider Comparison UI:**
    -   A Compare Providers button was added to the Projects page header.
    -   Clicking it opens a dialog that displays the baseline and variant LLM-generated plans side-by-side, along with the structured diff.
-   **Model Selector:** The model selection dropdowns on both Projects and Templates pages are now explicit and hard-coded to only show  or , based on the chosen provider (e.g., Claude provider only shows ). Free-form model input has been removed.

The application is currently in a stable state with core planning, templating, run history, and basic authentication APIs/UIs implemented, ready for comprehensive functionality testing.

The AI engineer successfully transitioned a planning-focused MVP into a chat-driven code generation application. Initial work involved fixing ESLint, implementing a multi-tenant UI with a central chat, project cards, and a project-specific builder view featuring resizable panels and styled tabs. A major pivot occurred when the user clarified the need for *actual code and preview generation* over *planning notes*. This led to significant backend (new  endpoint, chat persistence, artifact storage, LLM client hardening) and frontend (iframe preview, code viewer, auth gating, branding) updates. Persistent challenges included LLM fallback to stub due to missing API keys or brittle JSON parsing, and user-reported UI unresponsiveness, which were addressed by explicit error surfacing,  integration, and robust LLM response parsing. Despite automated tests passing, the user still experiences issues with genuine LLM output and chat dialog behavior, indicating further debugging is needed in the core generation pipeline or frontend state management.

<product_requirements>
The application's core goal is to be a full-stack, chat-driven design and development tool, integrating React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB.
1.  **Core Project Management**: Users can create projects with names/descriptions.
2.  **AI Code Generation**: LLMs generate structured code artifacts (frontend, backend, database files) and a full  based on project descriptions and chat prompts. Specific LLM models (, ) are enforced. A fallback to a deterministic stub plan/code is required if LLM calls fail.
3.  **Chat-driven UI**:
    *   **Home Page**: Features a centered chat for new sessions and a 4xN grid of existing project cards.
    *   **Project Page ()**: Divided into a 25% left pane (for chat and tabs: Home | Agent | Files) and a 75% right pane (for output and tabs: Preview | Code).
    *   **Interaction**: Chat input is bottom-aligned. Columns are resizable with square corners and reset to 25/75 on project switch. Tabs are styled as true tabs with active indicators.
4.  **Output Display**: The Preview tab renders  in an iframe; the Code tab shows a clickable file list and selected file content. Plans should not appear in Preview or Code. Visible progress (Generating...), AI/STUB badge, and explicit error messages are required.
5.  **Persistence**: Chat history and generated artifacts (, ) are stored server-side per project and loaded on project selection.
6.  **Authentication**: Basic email/password JWT authentication. Code generation strictly requires login, with an inline banner if unauthenticated.
7.  **Branding**: The application's brand is WΞBMΛTIC.dev.

**Key Files and Changes**:
-   : **New** file containing the  function, central to the code generation feature. It uses  for LLM calls, handles explicit model mapping (e.g., ), extracts JSON from LLM responses, and provides a stub fallback.
-   : Significantly updated to include  (containing  and ), ,  (AI/Stub), and  in the  schema. This enables rich project state.
-   : Modified to expose  for message persistence and  for initiating code/preview generation. Also added  for project updates like renaming.
-   : **New** entry point for the root  path, allowing users to start new projects via a central chat input and view existing projects in a grid.
-   : **New** core component for . It orchestrates the resizable layout, manages chat state, renders  in an  for the Preview tab, and displays code files in a split-pane viewer for the Code tab. Also handles authentication gating and progress/error feedback.
-   : Updated to reflect the WΞBMΛTIC.dev branding and shows Welcome back, {email} when authenticated.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Persist the left/right split size per project.
-   Show assistant messages in the chat when generation succeeds (e.g., “Generated 1 file”).
-   Add a loading state on the Preview tab iframe during generation.
-   Show a small “Generated at” timestamp from the last run.
-   Consider adding a temporary Debug section in the UI for API statuses if issues persist.

<current_work>
The application has been heavily refactored to be a chat-driven design and development tool. The  has been provided by the user and set in .

**Frontend State**:
-   **Branding**: All logos, logotext, and taglines are updated to WΞBMΛTIC.dev with a minimalist Ξ glyph icon.
-   **UI Layout**: The root path () presents  with a centered chat input for new projects and a grid of existing project cards below. The project detail page () is , featuring a resizable layout. The left column (25%) houses Home, Agent, and Files tabs. The right column (75%) houses Preview and Code tabs. All columns have square corners, and tabs are styled as actual tabs with active underlines.
-   **Chat & Generation Flow**:
    -   **Authentication**: Strict auth gating is in place. If unauthenticated, the Agent panel shows an inline Login required banner, disabling the textarea and Send button. After login, Send is enabled, and API calls use the JWT.
    -   **Home Page**: Entering a prompt and clicking Start Building creates a project, navigates to , and then triggers a server-side chat message append and code generation.
    -   **Agent Tab**: Chat input is bottom-aligned, with messages scrolling above. Sending a message appends it to the server-side chat history and triggers the  endpoint.
-   **Output Display**:
    -   **Preview Tab**: Renders the  received from the backend inside an .
    -   **Code Tab**: Displays a split view with a clickable file list on the left and the content of the selected file on the right.
    -   **Feedback**: Generating... messages, an AI or STUB badge (indicating LLM vs. fallback), and explicit red error messages are shown in the right panel for clear feedback.
-   **Project Management**: Project titles in the header are inline-editable, with changes persisted via a  API call. Switching projects resets the left/right panel split to 25/75 and reloads chat history and generated .

**Backend State**:
-   **LLM Integration**:  is set. The  module now forces explicit model selection ( for Claude,  for GPT) and includes robust JSON extraction to handle prose in LLM responses, preventing silent stub fallbacks.
-   **Endpoints**:  for persisting chat and  for code/preview generation are implemented.  supports project renaming.
-   **Data Model**: The  model in  includes  (with , ), , and the  (AI/Stub) and  from generation, ensuring the frontend can display rich output and feedback.

Despite these extensive changes and passing automated UI tests for the authenticated flow, the user's latest feedback indicates that actual LLM-generated output is still not consistently appearing, and the chat dialog behavior is not as expected, often resulting in stub output and no apparent chat interaction beyond project creation.
